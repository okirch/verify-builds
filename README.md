# verify-builds

These scripts can be used to compare the RPMs generated by two separate builds,
and display any changes. This helps ascertain that packages, even though they
have been rebuilt for some reason, are identical with the previous build.

The code does not aim to be clever or fast, but simple enough to verify
(by inspection) that it's not doing anything nefarious.

The directories containing the two different builds are specified at the
top of the script, and can be edited directly. The script expects these
to be two flat directories containing RPMs. For instance, when comparing e.g.
two typical installation media, which contain per-architecture subdirectories,
you would call

	./verify-media /mnt/oldmedium /mnt/newmedium

This will invoke the verify-one-directory for each architecture in turn, eg

	./verify-one-directory /mnt/oldmedium/aarch64 /mnt/newmedium/aarch64
